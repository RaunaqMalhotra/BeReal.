## Notes

Not that many challenges this time round. However, one thing to note is that in the video walkthrough, for some reason, my iPhone did not record entering the password while logging in but I did have to enter in a password to log in as shown in the Project 5 walkthrough. Hope you enjoy interacting with this app!
