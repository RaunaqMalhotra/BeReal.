## Notes

Setting the constraints was the biggest challenge yet again. Sometimes the picture wasn't showing up even after uploading it while some other times important labels were being cut off. After playing around with the constraints for almost 4 hours, I was able to figure it out. The rest was not too bad as it was very similar to lab!
